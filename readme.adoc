= Multi Product Demos : Instructor Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

Red Hat Solution Architects and consultants have requested _multi-product demos_ that they can:

. Learn from
. Leverage as the basis for demos / POCs that they utilize in the field

Red Hat GPTE has been directed to create and manage these multi-product demos.

These demos will be utilized at the 3 Red Hat Tech Exchanges in 2018.

== Comparison with GPTE course labs

GPTE middleware course lab instructions tend to be _step by step_ in nature.
This is particularly the case at the experienced and advanced levels.
Lab assets are typically a skeleton of the final solution.
GPTE middleware courses tend to be focused on functionality provided by a single Red Hat product.

These multi-product demos are different:

. Demo assets should consist of the final solution.
. The multi-product demo should be reproducible out of the box in Red Hat Partner Demo System (RHPDS).
. Demo instructions should highlight how to order and use the demo.

=== Project plans

. Planning will occur in each multi-product demo's link:https://github.com/redhat-gpe?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=rhte_&type=&language=[git repo].
. Each project git repo has a prefix called:  _rhte_.
. All issues should be assigned the following:
.. Assignee
.. Project (rhte)
.. Milestone
. [red]#Please make commits fine grained and specific to a github issue#
. [red]#Please reference the github issue for each commit in the commit message#
+
-----
$ git commit -m https://github.com/redhat-gpe/rhte_lab_04_api_mgmt_and_service_mesh/issues/15
-----

== Slides

There will be one slide deck per multi-product demo.
Please create slide decks in:  redhat.slides.com.

== OCP Infrastructure

All demos and student labs will be executed in OpenShift.

. *Development environment:*  Please use https://master.dev39.openshift.opentlc.com
. *ILTs* :
+
For each ILT, an appropriately sized OCP Workshop environment will be provisioned for each multi-product demo.  ie:  6 MW multi-product demos = 6 dedicated OCP workshop environments.

== CI / CD

=== Version Control

All aspects of each multi-product demo is to be version controlled.

NOTE:  These multi-product demos are not a GPTE course.
Therefore, there is not a need for assessment questions nor audio recording of slides.

NOTE:  Please implement slides in:  redhat.slides.com and then version control in this git project repo.

.. OCP templates
.. Jenkins pipeline

.. mock data set
.. unit and integration tests

=== Binary Repositories

Each OCP cluster comes provisioned with a Nexus in the `default` project.

Please utilize this nexus for the following:

. Proxy maven repository
. Repository for generated binary artifacts from your Jenkins pipelines
. Linux container image Repository

=== Code Analysis

=== Jenkins

We'll share a link:https://jenkins-rhte-jenkins.apps.dev39.openshift.opentlc.com[common multi-tenant Jenkins server] that will be provisioned and maintained by Hong.

Please develop your Jenkins pipelines using the groovy based workflow plugin.

The pipeline itself should be written in a file and version controlled as part of your lab assets.
